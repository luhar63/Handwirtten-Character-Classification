# Overview
A Deep CNN implementation with Pytorch to recognize Handwritten Characters

# Parameters:
  <b>Training “easy” blind test data set</b>
  1. For <b>(“easy” blind test data set)</b> all the parameters(ex epoch, learning rate) are listed in <b>./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/train.py</b> file.
  2. For specifying the paths for the files of the dataset and label set, please use the variables data_set_path and            label_set_path.
  3. Please place the the files of the dataset and label set in the Handwritten-Character-Recognition folder.
  4. The model will be generated in the ./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/model folder.
  5. All the details of the models during training process will be genrated in the ./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/metrics folder.
  
  <b>Testing “easy” blind test data set</b>
  1. For <b>(“easy” blind test data set)</b> all the parameters(ex epoch, learning rate) are listed in <b>Handwritten-Character-Recognition/test.py</b> file.
  2. For specifying the paths for the files of the dataset, please use the variables data_set_path variable.
  
  <b>Training Extra Credit</b>
  1. For <b>(“easy” blind test data set)</b> all the parameters(ex epoch, learning rate) are listed in <b>./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/train_extra_credit.py</b> file.
  2. For specifying the paths for the files of the dataset and label set, please use the variables data_set_path and            label_set_path.
  3. Please place the the files of the dataset and label set in the Handwritten-Character-Recognition folder.
  4. The model will be generated and stored in the ./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/model folder.
  5. All the details of the models during training process will be genrated in the ./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/metrics folder.
  
  <b>Testing Extra Credit</b>
  1. For <b>(“easy” blind test data set)</b> all the parameters(ex epoch, learning rate) are listed in <b>./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/test_extra_credit.py</b> file.
  2. For specifying the paths for the files of the dataset, please use the variables data_set_path variable.
  
# Caution
  To generate the model please run ./Handwritten-Character-Recognition/train.py and .Handwritten-Character-Recognition/train_extra_credit.py file first.
